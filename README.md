# 🛍️ Nero-Coinpicker

**Frictionless Crypto Commerce for Everyone**  
A seamless eCommerce x DeFi dApp built on **NERO Chain**, designed to onboard the next billion users into Web3 by making crypto transactions as easy as online shopping.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Nero-Coinpicker** is a decentralized platform that allows users to **buy and sell cryptocurrency with the simplicity of a traditional eCommerce experience**. Leveraging **NERO Chain's Paymaster (AA-Platform)**, we remove the friction of gas fees and offer flexible token payments—paving the way for mainstream adoption of DeFi.

This project was built for **WaveHack: Build Frictionless dApps for GameFi, SocialFi, and DeFi on NERO Chain** – **Wave 1 (Ideathon)**.

## 💡 What It Does

- Users can **connect their wallet**, select crypto assets, and **purchase or sell with one-click** checkout.
- **Paymaster system** supports **gasless transactions** and **custom fee logic**, enabling token-flexible payments.
- Clean and intuitive UI modeled after eCommerce flows to simplify the crypto buying process.

## 🎯 The Problem It Solves

- Complex gas fees, confusing wallets, and unintuitive UX have kept everyday users away from crypto.
- Lack of mainstream-ready crypto platforms that look and feel like Web2 apps.
- Limited use of tokens outside trading—users want to spend crypto, not just hold it.

We bootstrapped the app using `Next.js` with a React-based component structure. Styling is managed via **TailwindCSS** and **MUI**, while crypto wallet connection and Web3 calls are handled by **wagmi**, **ethers.js**, and **RainbowKit**. The project architecture integrates **NERO’s AA-platform** for frictionless, gasless transactions through Paymaster configuration.
